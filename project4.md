## Project description

This is a simple Chat Room server and allows multiple clients to connect to it using a client-side script. The code uses the concept of sockets and threading. 

## How to view program

Users can download the server and client code (must have python extension) and then open command prompt. They can then choose their IP address and port number.
```bash
cd ../chat-room-server-master/code
python chat_server.py 127.0.0.1 4000
```
```bash
cd ../chat-room-server-master/code
python client.py 127.0.0.1 4000
```

## UI Design

Almost every program requires user interaction, even command-line programs. Include in this section the tasks the user can complete and what the program does. You don't need to include how it works here; that information may go in the project description or in an additional section, depending on its significance.
- Everyone who will be using the program needs to be on the same network.
- Anyone who wants to join the chat needs to have the client code on their device.
- The host needs to have the server code running on their device before clients can join.
- The users who want to join the chat needs to put in the same IP address and port number as the server.
- This can be run on linux or windows.
- Once connected the users can now freely chat back and forth.
