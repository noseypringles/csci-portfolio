## Project description

The purpose for this project is to have a working e-commerce (online shopping) website that can handle sales transactions, inventory tracking, and saves information/receipts in a database for a certain amount of time before it deletes it. The customer should be able to view products and make a purchase and with the purchase, see that the transaction is a success and money is taken from the source of pay provided. Along with a purchase, the admin of the website should see that a transaction was made and see the purchases.
