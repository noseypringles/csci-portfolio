## Project description

[Rae Riding Lessons](http://raeridinglessons.infinityfreeapp.com/) is website designed so that users can signup for horse riding lessons. 

Once a user registers for an account, they can veiw a calendar of lessons that are available to them based on the their skill level. The user can then sign up for the lesson which will be added to another calendar on the user's profile page. Additionally, an admin can make changes to the user's skill level, make a user an admin, make notes about users, add news to the home page, and add new lessons for users.

## How to view program

Users can download the server and client code (must have python extension) and then open command prompt. They can then choose their IP address and port number.
```bash
cd ../chat-room-server-master/code
python chat_server.py 127.0.0.1 4000
```
```bash
cd ../chat-room-server-master/code
python client.py 127.0.0.1 4000
```



## UI Design

Almost every program requires user interaction, even command-line programs. Include in this section the tasks the user can complete and what the program does. You don't need to include how it works here; that information may go in the project description or in an additional section, depending on its significance.
