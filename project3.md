## Project description
In this project, it is mapping a student's first and last name to an ID aka a string to an integer.


## How to view program
You view this program running linux and having the makefile, main.cpp, map.cpp, and map.hpp files. You type "make map-test" and the program will run program. 

## UI Design
Our Map shall map a student’s first and last name to an id. In other words, we are mapping a
string to an integer. Names shall consist of:
• a c-string (i.e., null-terminated character array) with the combined first and last name;
• between each first and last name shall be a space; and
• contain only the 26 letters of the English alphabet; the first letter of each name shall be
capitalized; other letters may be upper or lower case (e.g., "John Smith").
Every student’s name shall map to a single nonnegative 32-bit integer (unsigned int) id.

## 3. Additional Considerations

The code can be made to run faster in future updates.
